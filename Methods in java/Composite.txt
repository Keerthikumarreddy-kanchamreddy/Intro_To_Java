Problem statement
Your task is to write a function named print_composite that prints if there are any composite numbers up to a given number, n.



Composite numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have more than two positive divisors. In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.


Sample Input 1:
10
Sample Output 1:
4
6
8
9
10
Explanation :
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. In other words, it is not a prime number. Here are the composite numbers between 2 and 10:
4, 6, 8, 9, and 10

public class Solution{
    public static void print_composite(int n)
    {

        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++){
            boolean comp = false;
            for(int j=2; j< i ; j++){

                if(i%j == 0){
                    comp = true;
                }

                if(comp){
                    System.out.println(i);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
