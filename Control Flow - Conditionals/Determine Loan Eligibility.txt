Problem statement
You are tasked with creating a program for a bank that determines whether a person is eligible for a loan. The eligibility criteria for the loan are as follows:

Conditions :
The person must be at least 18 years old.
The person must have a monthly income of at least $2,000.
The person must not have any outstanding loans with the bank.
Hint for Python Users:
Use the lower() function to take boolean input.
Like this, has_loans = input("").lower() == 'true'. 

16
27000.78
true 
Sample output 1:
You are not eligible for the loan.
Sample input 2:
30
27450.78
false 
Sample output 2:
You are eligible for the loan.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       // write your code logic ...

       Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
       int age = s.nextInt();
       double income = s.nextDouble();
       boolean loan = s.nextBoolean();

       if ((age > 18) && (income > 2000.0) && (loan == false)){
           System.out.println("You are eligible for the loan.");
       }else {
           System.out.println("You are not eligible for the loan.");
       }

       
    }
}
